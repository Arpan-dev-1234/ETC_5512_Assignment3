Individual Assignment


Covid-19 had a significant impact on the fiscal, home and work experiences of Melbourne residents during 2020. To understand the impact of changes in 2020, researchers conducted a survey of 1000 Melbourne residents to explore the difference between their 2019 and 2020 experience with regards to mental health, financial stability and home life.

The survey was collected online through a survey platform called Qualtrics in the month of January, 2021. Respondents were invited to participate through a mailed invitation, from where they were encouraged to scan a QR code and complete the survey. Respondents first gave informed consent for the collection and use of their data, and the eventual distribution of de-identified data. At the conclusion of the survey, respondents gave an email address to which a Coles giftcard worth $20 was sent in compensation for their time.

This survey is a hypothetical example of data that might have been collected during this period. It does not have ethics approval, nor was it actually sent to participants. The data you have been given is simulated for teaching purposes and is not intended for analysis or interpretation.

# Tasks carried out:

1. Identify and remove the direct identifiers from the data.
2.  Removing direct identifiers isn’t sufficient to protect the identify of respondents. Design a de-identification strategy so that respondents are unable to identify themselves in the data. You can assume that while the participants will remember how they responded to the basic demographics (pages 1 and 2 of the questionnaire), they won’t remember their exact responses to the other items. Demonstrate that no person can be identified from their demographics.
3.  Rename the remaining variables. Rename the column names and the levels of the variables. Split composite variables into seperate variables so that we have columns for year, item and (for some) response. Save the data in the data folder as a .csv file.
